# Contact-Management-System-in-C
The basis of a contact management system is the idea of creating personal or organizational records of contacts, adding this data and updating it. Here, users can add their contact information securely and quickly. The system makes it easy to keep records of each person. The entire project was developed using the "C" programming language and various variables and strings. Consumers will find this little project easy to use and understand.
